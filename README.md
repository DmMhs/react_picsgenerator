# react_picsgenerator
Simple React-based pics generator. It provides the next functionality: choose a random pic of a guitar from a local directory. Check out the screenshots  to see how project works. All these files have to be placed inside of 'src' folder of your React project. Thanks to Brice Ayres for inspiration, don't forget to check his youtube channel.
